#Overview of Jumping Game 

Jumping is a game that evaluates your concentration and ability to jump at the right tim, 
and then develops the game where the player can register a special account for him and play with all the players who like this kind of game.
Once done, calculate the winner through mathematical theory and work out an equation. Your name is (score), 
then the winner's result will appear on the screen.


#Goals and objective

**Goals** are objectives that a person or a system desires to achieve. In a game a goal is what we strive for (Save the little one from the bomb).

**Objectives** are fundamental to the games; They define what the player must do to win the game, and give the player a sense of achievement and progress. 
Goals are what a player reaches in the game and are traditionally quantifiable, meaning that goals are quantifiable entities, depending on
The goals we use. By setting measurable goals, it is possible to know when goals will be reached.

The player will usually know if they have reached the goal by counting the highest number of jumps.

#Challenging

One of the most important challenges we faced was calculating the winning equation, dealing with and linking databases, and then learning how to show that data.
